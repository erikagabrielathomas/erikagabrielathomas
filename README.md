Welcome to my GitHub page! My name is erika, but I go by 'E,' but whichever is OK! I am a student at Ohio State University, studying Management Information Systems, and I plan to go into software development in the business sector once I graduate. I am employed with Ohio State's Office of Technology and Innovation as a Full-Stack Developer. Currently, we are working on preparing an application for multi-tenancy to conduct a planned full back-end swap to .Net and C#.
